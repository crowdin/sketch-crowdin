This plugin lets you connect your [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) projects together.
Localize the UI and review your design within different languages before programming starts.
Send the whole page or separate artboards for translation to Crowdin in a click and fetch translations back to Sketch. Preview and customize the translated copy directly in Sketch. 
Also it gives ability to use source strings from Crowdin in your Sketch project and upload artborad screenshots.
