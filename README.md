# Crowdin Sketch plugin

This plugin lets you integrate your Sketch project with Crowdin. Once you finished with design you can push strings into the Crowdin and you also able to translate your project and fetch translations from Crowdin in order to review your design within different languages.

## Requirements

In order to start working with this plugin you need to set following properties:

1. Access token [Personal Access Token](https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/personal-access-tokens/#creating-a-personal-access-token) or [OAuth Access Token](https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/authorizing-oauth-apps/#make-requests-to-the-api-with-the-access-token-returned).
2. Organization name (might be optional).
3. Link to Crowdin project.

Access token and organization are global parameters which will be used across all Sketch projects. But Crowdin project should be defined per each Sketch project (also known as Sketch document).
