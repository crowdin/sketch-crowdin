This plugin lets you connect your [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) projects together.
Localize the UI and review your design within different languages before programming starts.
Send the whole page or separate artboards for translation to Crowdin in a click and fetch translations back to Sketch. Preview and customize the translated copy directly in Sketch.
